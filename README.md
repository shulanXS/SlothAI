# SlothAI


## Project Introduction

An enterprise-level AI Love Master Agent based on Spring Boot 3, Spring AI, RAG, Tool Calling, and MCP, offering emotional guidance with multi-round conversations, memory persistence, and RAG retrieval. Using the ReAct pattern, it autonomously calls tools for tasks like web search, downloads, and PDF plan generation.

The `AI Love Master App` can rely on the AI large - language model to solve users' emotional problems. It supports multi - round conversations, Q&A based on a custom knowledge base, autonomous tool - calling, and using MCP services to complete tasks. For example, it can call the map service to obtain nearby locations and make a dating plan.
